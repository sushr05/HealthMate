( for example, it has been said that nobody knows more about acute pharmacology than an anaesthetist. ) the present edition of the textbook reflects the advances in therapeutics since the publica - tion of the fourth edition. it is interesting to follow in all the editions of the book, for example, how the treatment of tumours has progressed. it was about the time of the first edition that trounce set up the first oncology clinic at guy ’ s hospital in which he investigated the value of combined radiation and chemotherapy and drug cocktails in the treatment of lymphomas. john trounce was pleased to see his textbook ( and his subject ) in the expert hands of professor ritter and his colleagues. roy spector professor emeritus in applied pharmacology, university of london foreword',\n",
       "  'clinical pharmacology is the science of drug use in humans. clinicians of all specialties pre - scribe drugs on a daily basis, and this is both one of the most useful but also one of the most dangerous activities of our professional lives. understanding the principles of clinical pharma - cology is the basis of safe and effective therapeutic practice, which is why this subject forms an increasingly important part of the medical curriculum. this textbook is addressed primarily to medical students and junior doctors of all special - ties, but also to other professionals who increasingly prescribe medicines ( including pharma - cists, nurses and some other allied professionals ). clinical pharmacology is a fast moving subject and the present edition has been completely revised and updated. it differs from the fourth edition in that it concentrates exclusively on aspects that students should know and understand, rather than including a lot of reference material. this has enabled us to keep its length down. another feature has been to include many new illustrations to aid in grasping mechanisms and principles. the first section deals with general principles including pharmacodynamics, pharmaco - kinetics and the various factors that modify drug disposition and drug interaction. we have kept algebraic formulations to a minimum. drug metabolism is approached from a practical viewpoint, with discussion of the exciting new concept of personalized medicine. adverse drug reactions and the use of drugs at the extremes of age and in pregnancy are covered, and the introduction of new drugs is discussed from the viewpoint of students who will see many new treatments introduced during their professional careers. many patients use herbal or other alternative medicines and there is a new chapter on this important topic. there is a chap - ter on gene and cell - based therapies, which are just beginning to enter clinical practice. the remaining sections of the book deal comprehensively with major systems ( nervous, musculo - skeletal, cardiovascular',\n",

       "  '12 pharmacokinetics clearance is the best measure of the efficiency with which a drug is eliminated from the body, whether by renal excretion, metabolism or a combination of both. the concept will be familiar from physiology, where clearances of substances with particular properties are used as measures of physiologically important processes, including glomerular filtration rate and renal or hepatic plasma flow. for therapeutic drugs, knowing the clearance in an individual patient enables the physician to adjust the maintenance dose to achieve a desired target steady - state concentration, since required administration rate / h11005desired css / h11003clearance this is useful in drug development. it is also useful in clinical practice when therapy is guided by plasma drug concentrations. however, such situations are limited ( chapter 8 ). furthermore, some chemical pathology laboratories report plasma concentra - tions of drugs in molar terms, whereas drug doses are usually expressed in units of mass. consequently, one needs to know the molecular weight of the drug to calculate the rate of administra - tion required to achieve a desired plasma concentration. when drug infusion is stopped, the plasma concentration declines towards zero. the time taken for plasma concentration to halve is the half - life ( t1 / 2 ). a one - compartment model with first - order elimination predicts an exponential decline in con - centration when the infusion is discontinued, as shown in figure 3. 1. after a second half - life has elapsed, the concentration will have halved again ( i. e. a 75 % drop in concentration to 25 % of the original concentration ), and so on. the increase in drug concentration when the infusion is started is also exponential, being the inverse of the decay curve. this has a very important clinical implication, namely that t1 / 2 not only determines the time',\n",

( ‘ surrogate ’ because what the prescriber really wants to achieve is to reduce the risk of a clinical event, such as a stroke, heart attack, pulmonary embolism, etc. ) for example, antihypertensive drugs are monitored by their effect on blood pressure ( chapter 28 ), statins by their effect on serum cholesterol ( chapter 27 ), oral anticoagulants by their effect on the international normalized ratio ( inr ) ( chapter 30 ). many other examples will be encountered in later chapters. in some circumstances, however, there is no good continu - ous variable to monitor, especially for diseases with an unpre - dictable or fluctuating course. measuring drug concentrations in plasma or serum identifies only pharmacokinetic variabil - ity, but can sometimes usefully guide dose adjustment, for example in treating an epileptic patient with an anticonvulsant drug. measuring drug concentrations for use in this way is often referred to as ‘ therapeutic drug monitoring ’, and is the focus of this chapter. role of drug monitoring in therapeutics measurement of drug concentrations is sometimes a useful complement to clinical',\n",

( drugs that work via active metabolites, and drugs with irreversible actions, are unsuited to this approach. tolerance also restricts the usefulness of plasma concentrations. ) 2. effect cannot readily be assessed quantitatively by clinical observation. 3. inter - individual variability in plasma drug concentrations from the same dose is large ( e. g. phenytoin ). 4. there is a low therapeutic index ( e. g. if the ratio of toxic concentration / effective concentration is / h110212 ). 5. several drugs are being given concurrently and serious interactions are anticipated. 6. replacement treatment ( for example, of thyroxine ) is to be optimized. 7. apparent ‘ resistance ’ to the action of a drug needs an explanation, when non - compliance is suspected. another indication, distinct from therapeutic drug monitor - ing, for measuring drug concentrations in plasma is in clinical toxicology. such measurements can guide management when specific intervention is contemplated in treating a poisoned patient ( e. g. with paracetamol or aspirin ). practical aspects drug distribution and the location ( tissue and cell ) of the drug ’ s target influence the relationship between plasma drug concentration and effect. a constant tissue to plasma drug concentration ratio only occurs during the terminal β - phase of',\n",

       "  'fertilization and implantation animal studies suggest that interference with the fetus before 17 days gestation causes abortion, i. e. if pregnancy continues the fetus is unharmed. organogenesis / embryonic stage at this stage, the fetus is differentiating to form major organs, and this is the critical period for teratogenesis. teratogens cause deviations or abnormalities in the development of the embryo that are compatible with prenatal life and are observable post - natally. drugs that interfere with this process can cause gross structural defects ( e. g. thalidomide phocomelia ). some drugs are confirmed teratogens ( table 9. 1 ), but for many the evidence is inconclusive. thalidomide was unusual in the way in which a very small dose of the drug given on only one or two occasions between the fourth and seventh weeks of pregnancy predictably produced serious malformations. fetogenic stage in this stage, the fetus undergoes further development and maturation. even after organogenesis is almost complete, drugs can still have significant adverse effects on fetal growth and development. • ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers cause fetal and neonatal renal dysfunction. • drugs used to treat maternal hyperthyroidism can cause fetal and neonatal hypothyroidism. • tetracycline antibiotics inhibit growth of fetal bones and stain teeth. • aminoglycosides cause fetal viiith nerve damage. • opioids and cocaine taken regularly during pregnancy can lead to fetal drug dependency. • warfarin can cause fetal intracerebral bleeding. • indometacin, a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, is used under specialist supervision to assist closure of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. • some hormones can cause inappropriate virilization or feminization. • anti',\n",

       "  'prescribing in pregnancy the prescription of drugs to a pregnant woman is a balance between possible adverse drug effects on the fetus and the risk to mother and fetus of leaving maternal disease inadequately treated. effects on the human fetus cannot be reliably pre - dicted from animal studies – hence one should prescribe drugs for which there is experience of safety over many years in preference to new or untried drugs. the smallest effective dose should be used. the fetus is most sensitive to adverse drug effects during the first trimester. it has been estimated that nearly half of all pregnancies in the uk are unplanned, and that most women do not present to a doctor until five to seven weeks after conception. thus, sexually active women of childbearing potential should be assumed to be pregnant until it has been proved otherwise. delayed toxicity is a sinister problem ( e. g. diethylstilbestrol ) and if the teratogenic effect of thalidomide had not produced such an unusual congenital abnormality, namely phocomelia, its detection might have been delayed further. if drugs ( or envi - ronmental toxins ) have more subtle effects on the fetus ( e. g. a minor reduction in intelligence ) or cause an increased incidence of a common disease ( e. g. atopy ), these effects may never be detected. many publications demand careful prospective con - trolled clinical trials, but the ethics and practicalities of such studies often make their demands unrealistic. a more rational approach is for drug regulatory bodies, the pharmaceutical industry and drug information agencies to collaborate closely and internationally to collate all information concerning drug use in pregnancy ( whether inadvertent or planned ) and associ - ate these with outcome. this will require significant investment of time and money, as well as considerable encouragement to doctors and midwives to',\n",

       "  'pharmacodynamic changes 57 distribution ageing is associated with loss of lean body mass, and with an increased ratio of fat to muscle and body water. this enlarges the volume of distribution of fat - soluble drugs, such as diazepamand lidocaine, whereas the distribution of polar drugs such as digoxin is reduced compared to younger adults. changes in plasma proteins also occur with ageing, especially if associated with chronic disease and malnutrition, with a fall in albumin and a rise in gamma - globulin concentrations. hepatic metabolism there is a decrease in the hepatic clearance of some but not all drugs with advancing age. a prolonged plasma half - life ( figure 11. 2 ), can be the result either of reduced clearance or of increased apparent volume of distribution. ageing reduces metabolism of some drugs ( e. g. benzodiazepines ) as evidenced by reduced hepatic clearance. the reduced clearance of benzodiazepines has important clinical consequences, as does the long half - life of several active metabolites ( chapter 18 ). slow accumulation may lead to adverse effects whose onset may occur days or weeks after initiating therapy. consequently, confusion or memory impairment may be falsely attributed to ageing rather than to adverse drug effects. renal excretion the most important cause of drug accumulation in the elderly is declining renal function. many healthy elderly individuals have a glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) / h1102150 ml / min. although glomerular filtration rate declines with age, this is not necessar - ily reflected by serum creatinine, which can remain within the range defined as ‘ normal ’ for a younger adult population despite a marked decline in renal function. this is related to the lower endogenous production of creatinine in',\n",

       "  '66 adverse drug reactions monitoring from national statistics a great deal of information is available from death certificates, hospital discharge diagnoses and similar records. from these data, it may be possible to detect a change in disease trends and relate this to drug therapy. perhaps the best - known example of this is the increased death rate in young asthmatics noted in the mid - 1960s, which was associated with overuse of bron - chodilator inhalers containing non - specific β - adrenoceptor agonists ( e. g. adrenaline and / or isoprenaline ). although rel - atively inexpensive, the shortcomings of this method are obvi - ous, particularly in diseases with an appreciable mortality, since large numbers of patients must suffer before the change is detectable. data interpretation is particularly difficult when hospital discharges are used as a source of information, since discharge diagnosis is often provisional or incomplete, and may be revised during follow up. however, they can combine with high molecular weight enti - ties, usually proteins, to form an antigenic hapten conjugate. the factors that determine the development of allergy to a drug are not fully understood. some drugs ( e. g. penicillin ) are more likely to cause allergic reactions than others, and type i ( immediate anaphylactic ) reactions are more common in patients with a history of atopy. a correlation between aller - gic reactions involving immunoglobulin e ( ige ) and human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) serotypes has been reported, so genetic factors may also be important. there is some evidence that drug allergies are more common in older people, in women and in those with a previous history of drug reaction. however, this may merely represent increased frequencies of drug expo - sure in these patient groups',\n",

       "  'plasma and tissue binding site interactions one large group of potential drug interactions that are seldom clinically important consists of drugs that displace one another from binding sites on plasma albumin or α - 1 acid glyco - protein ( aag ) or within tissues. this is a common occurrence and can readily be demonstrated in plasma or solutions of albumin / aag in vitro. however, the simple expectation that the displacing drug will increase the effects of the displaced drug by increasing its free ( unbound ) concentration is seldom evident in clinical practice. this is because drug clearance ( renal or metabolic ) also depends directly on the concentra - tion of free drug. consider a patient receiving a regular main - tenance dose of a drug. when a second displacing drug is commenced, the free concentration of the first drug rises only transiently before increased renal or hepatic elimination reduces total ( bound plus free ) drug, and restores the free con - centration to that which prevailed before the second drug was started. consequently, any increased effect of the displaced drug is transient, and is seldom important in practice. it must, however, be taken into account if therapy is being guided by measurements of plasma drug concentrations, as most such determinations are of total ( bound plus free ) rather than just free concentration ( chapter 8 ). an exception, where a transient increase in free concentra - tion of a circulating substance ( albeit not a drug ) can have dev - astating consequences, is provided by bilirubin in premature babies whose ability to metabolize bile pigments is limited. unconjugated bilirubin is bound by plasma albumin, and inju - dicious treatment with drugs, such as sulphonamides, that displace it from these binding sites permits diffusion of free bilirubin across the immature blood –',\n",

       "  'clinical drug development 89 differences should be reported as confidence intervals ( usu - ally 95 % confidence intervals ). such intervals will diminish as the sample size is increased. confidence intervals reflect the effects of sampling variability on the precision of a procedure, and it is important to quote them when a ‘ non - significant ’ result is obtained, and when comparing different estimates of effectiveness ( e. g. drug a in one trial may have performed twice as well as placebo, whereas drug b in another trial may have performed only 1. 5 times as well as placebo ; whether drug a is probably superior to drug b will be apparent from inspection of the two sets of confidence intervals ). if many parameters are analysed, some apparently ‘ signifi - cant ’ differences will be identified by chance. for example, if 100 parameters are analysed in a comparison of two treat - ments, one would expect to see a ‘ significant ’ difference in approximately five of those parameters. it is therefore very important to prespecify the primary trial end - point and sec - ondary end - points that will be analysed. statistical corrections can be applied to allow for the number of comparisons made. one must also consider the clinical importance of any statistic - ally significant result. for example, a drug may cause a statis - tically significant decrease in blood pressure in a study, but if it is only 0. 2 mmhg it is not of any clinical relevance. clinical drug development for most new drugs, the development process – following a satisfactory preclinical safety evaluation – proceeds through four distinct phases. these are summarized below. figure 15. 3 illustrates the overall decision - making process for determin - ing whether or not a new therapy will be clinically useful. phase i the initial studies of drugs in humans usually involve healthy male volunteers unless toxicity is predictable ( e',\n",

( human gene sequences have also been inserted into mice to develop murine models of human dis - ease. ) in 1982, the first recombinant pharmaceutical product, human recombinant insulin, was marketed. since then, more than 100 medicines derived via biotechnology have been licensed for use in patients, whilst hundreds more are cur - rently undergoing clinical trials. successes include hormones, coagulation factors, enzymes and monoclonal antibodies, extending the range of useful therapeutic agents from low molecular weight chemical entities to macromolecules. once discovered, some biotechnology products are manufactured by chemical synthesis rather than by biological processes. examples of recombinant products are listed in table 16. 1. in parallel with these advances, the human genome project is establishing associations between specific genes and specific diseases. detailed medical histories and genetic information are being collected and collated from large population sam - ples. this will identify not only who is at risk of a potential dis - ease and may thus benefit from prophylactic therapy, but also who may be at risk of',\n",

       "  'insomnia lasting only a few days is commonly the result of acute stress, acute medical illness or jet lag. insomnia lasting longer than three weeks is ‘ chronic ’. sleep although we spend about one - third of our lives asleep, the function of sleep is not known. sleep consists of two alternat - ing states, namely rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep and non - rem sleep. during rem sleep, dreaming occurs. this is accompanied by maintenance of synaptic connections and increased cerebral blood flow. non - rem sleep includes sleep of different depths, and in the deepest form the electroenceph - alogram ( eeg ) shows a slow wave pattern, growth hormone is secreted and protein synthesis occurs. drugs produce states that superficially resemble physio - logical sleep, but lack the normal mixture of rem and non - rem phases. hypnotics usually suppress rem sleep, and when discontinued, there is an excess of rem ( rebound ) which is associated with troubled dreams punctuated by repeated wak - enings. during this withdrawal state, falling from wakefulness to non - rem sleep is also inhibited by feelings of tension and anxiety. the result is that both patient and doctor are tempted to restart medication to suppress the withdrawal phenomena, resulting in a vicious cycle. general principles of management of insomnia it is important to exclude causes of insomnia that require treat - ing in their own right. these include : • pain ( e. g. due to arthritis or dyspepsia ) ; • dyspnoea ( e. g. as a result of left ventricular failure, bronchospasm or cough ) ; • frequency of micturition ; • full bladder and / or loaded colon in the elderly ; • drugs ( see table 18. 1 ) ; table 18. 1 : drugs',\n",

       "  '112 schizophrenia and behavioural emergencies drugs used in treatment conventional antipsychotic drugs the principal action of the conventional antipsychotic drugs ( see table 19. 1 ), such as chlorpromazine ( a phenothiazine ) and haloperidol ( a butyrophenone ), is an antagonism of d2 recep - tors in the forebrain. the effect on d 1 receptors is variable. blockade of the d 2 receptors induces extrapyramidal effects. repeated adminstration causes an increase in d2 - receptor sen - sitivity due to an increase in abundance of these receptors. this appears to underlie the tardive dyskinesias that are caused by prolonged use of the conventional antipsychotic drugs. the choice of drug is largely determined by the demands of the clinical situation, in particular the degree of sedation needed and the patient ’ s susceptibility to extrapyramidal tox - icity and hypotension. uses these include the following : 1. schizophrenia – antipsychotic drugs are more effective against first - rank ( positive ) symptoms ( hallucinations, thought disorder, delusions, feelings of external control ) than against negative symptoms ( apathy and withdrawal ) ; 2. other excited psychotic states, including mania and delirium ; 3. anti - emetic and anti - hiccough ; 4. premedication and in neuroleptanalgesia ; 5. terminal illness, including potentiating desired actions of opioids while reducing nausea and vomiting ; 6. severe agitation and panic ; 7. aggressive and violent behaviour ; 8. movement and mental disorders in huntington ’ s disease. adverse effects 1. the most common adverse effects are dose - dependent extensions of pharmacological actions : • extrapyramidal symptoms ( related to tight binding',\n",

       "  'worse, the tricyclic antidepressants block amine reuptake from synapses within one or two hours of administration, but take from ten days to four weeks to alleviate depression. such a long time - course suggests a resetting of postsynaptic or presynaptic receptor sensitivity. another theory of depression is the serotonin - only hypothesis. this theory emphasizes the role of 5ht and downplays that of na in the causation of depression, and is backed by the effect - iveness of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or ssri class of drugs, in the treatment of depression. however, it also does not explain the delay in onset of the clinical effect of antidepressant drugs, including the ssris, and again receptor resetting has to be invoked. also, many strands of evidence sug - gest that na does indeed have an important role in depression. the permissive hypothesis of mania / depression suggests that the control of emotional behaviour results from a balance between na and 5ht. according to this theory, both the manic phase and the depressive phase of bipolar disorder are characterized by low central 5ht function. evidence suggests that brain 5ht systems dampen or inhibit a range of functions involving other neurotransmitters. mood disorders result from the removal of the serotonin damper. this hypothesis postu - lates that low levels of 5ht permit abnormal levels of na to cause depression or mania. if 5ht cannot control na and na falls to abnormally low levels, the patient becomes depressed. on the other hand, if the level of 5ht falls and the level of na becomes abnormally high, the patient becomes manic. according to this hypothesis, antidepressant drugs are effect - ive to the degree that they restore the ability of 5ht to control na,',\n",

       "  'gaba receptor – channel com - plex includes benzodiazepine and barbiturate recognition sites which can potentiate gaba anti - epileptic activity. vigabatrin ( γ - vinyl - γ - aminobutyric acid ) irreversibly inhibits gaba transam - inase, the enzyme that inactivates gaba. the resulting increase in synaptic gaba probably explains its anti - epileptic activity. glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. a glutamate receptor, the n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor, is important in the genesis and propagation of high - frequency discharges. lamotrigine inhibits glutamate release and has anticonvulsant activity. mechanisms of action of anti - epileptic drugs the pathophysiology of epilepsy and the mode of action of anti - epileptic drugs are poorly understood. these agents are not all sedative, but selectively block repetitive discharges at concen - trations below those that block normal impulse conduction. carbamazepineand phenytoin prolong the inactivated state of the sodium channel and reduce the likelihood of repetitive action potentials. consequently, normal cerebral activity, which is associated with relatively low action potential frequencies, is unaffected, whilst epileptic discharges are suppressed. key points • epilepsy affects 0. 5 % of the population. • it is characterized by recurrent seizures. key points mechanisms of action of anticonvulsants • the action of anticonvulsants is poorly understood. • they cause blockade of repetitive discharges at a concentration that does not block normal impulse conduction. • this may be achieved via enhancement of gaba action or inhibition of sodium channel function. general principles of treatment of',\n",

( dihydrocodeine is similar, and is a commonly prescribed alternative. ) although codeine is converted to morphine, it produces little euphoria and has low addiction potential. as a result, it has been used for many years as an analgesic for moderate pain, as a cough suppres - sant and for symptomatic relief of diarrhoea. adverse effects common adverse effects involve constipation, nausea and vomiting. pharmacokinetics free morphine also appears in plasma following codeine administration, and codeine acts as a prodrug, producing a low but sustained concentration of morphine. individuals who are cyp2d6 poor metabolizers convert much less codeineto morphine, and consequently experience less, if any, analgesic effect. pentazocine pentazocineis a partial agonist on opioid receptors ( especially κ - receptors, with additional actions on σ - receptors, which result in hallucinations and thought disturbance ). it also increases pulmonary artery pressure. its use is not recom - mended. buprenorphine use buprenorphine is a partial agonist. it is given sublingually. it antagonizes full agonists and',\n",

       "  'cardiac output may be increased in children or young adults during the earliest stages of essential hypertension, but by the time hypertension is established in middle life the pre - dominant haemodynamic abnormality is an elevated periph - eral vascular resistance. with ageing, elastic fibres in the aorta and conduit arteries are replaced by less compliant collagen causing arterial stiffening and systolic hypertension, which is common in the elderly. the kidney plays a key role in the control of blood pressure and in the pathogenesis of hypertension. excretion of salt and water controls intravascular volume. secretion of renin influ - ences vascular tone and electrolyte balance via activation of the renin – angiotensin – aldosterone system. renal disease ( vascular, parenchymal or obstructive ) is a cause of arterial hypertension. conversely, severe hypertension causes glomerular sclerosis, manifested clinically by proteinuria and reduced glomerular fil - tration, leading to a vicious circle of worsening blood pressure and progressive renal impairment. renal cross - transplantation experiments in several animal models of hypertension, as well as observations following therapeutic renal transplantation in humans, both point to the importance of the kidney in the pathogenesis of hypertension. the sympathetic nervous system is also important in the control of blood pressure, providing background α receptor - mediated vasoconstrictor tone and βreceptor - mediated cardiac stimulation. sympathetic activity varies rapidly to adjust for changes in cardiovascular demand with alterations in posture and physical activity. it is also activated by emotional states such as anxiety, and this can result in ‘ white - coat ’ hyperten - sion. a vasoconstrictor peptide, endothelin, released by the endothelium contributes to vaso',\n",

       "  'can cause retinal haemorrhage and blindness. cataracts are common. diabetic neuropathy causes a glove and stocking distribution of loss of sensation with associated painful paraesthesiae. approximately one - third of diabetic patients develop diabetic nephropathy, which leads to renal failure. microalbuminuria is a forerunner of overt diabetic nephropathy. macrovascular disease is the result of accelerated atheroma and results in an increased incidence of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and stroke. there is a strong asso - ciation ( pointed out by reaven in his 1988 banting lecture at the annual meeting of the american diabetes association ) between diabetes and obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia ( especially hypertriglyceridaemia ), and type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with endothelial dysfunction, an early event in atherogenesis ( chapter 27 ). principles of management it is important to define ambitious but achievable goals for each patient. in young type 1 patients there is good evidence that improved diabetic control reduces microvascular complications. it is well worth trying hard to minimize the metabolic derange - ment associated with diabetes mellitus in order to reduce the development of such complications. education and support are essential to motivate the patient to learn how to adjust their insulin dose to optimize glycaemic control. this can only be achieved by the patient performing blood glucose monitoring at home and learning to adjust their insulin dose accordingly. the treatment regimen must be individualized. a common strategy is to combine injections of a short - acting insulin before each meal with a once daily injection of a long - acting insulin to pro - vide a low steady background level during the night. follow up must include structured care with assessment of chronic',\n",

( note : this was not commercially successful, and has been withdrawn in the uk for this reason. ) the effec - tive dose of human insulin is usually rather less than that of animal insulins because of the lack of production of blocking antibodies. consequently, the dose is reduced when switching from animal to human insulin. soluble insulin is the only preparation suitable for intra - venous use. it is administered intravenously in diabetic emer - gencies and given subcutaneously before meals in chronic management. formulations of human insulins are available in various ratios of short - acting and longer - lasting forms ( e. g. 30 : 70, commonly used twice daily ). some of these are marketed 286 diabetes mellitus',\n",

       "  'and interferes with the generation of oxygen radicals by macrophages, thereby interfering with the presentation of anti - gen to lymphocytes. methimazoledoes not affect hormone secretion directly. thus hormone release decreases after a latent period, during which time the thyroid becomes depleted of hormone. adverse effects carbimazole is usually well tolerated, although pruritus and rashes are fairly common. these usually respond to switching topropylthiouracil ( see below ). neutropenia is a rare but potentially fatal adverse effect. patients must be warned to report sore throat or other evidence of infection immediately, an urgent white cell count must be obtained and the drug should be stopped if there is neutropenia. nausea, hair loss, drug fever, leukopenia and arthralgia are rare, but recognized adverse effects. use of carbimazole during pregnancy has rarely been associated with aplasia cutis in the newborn. pharmacokinetics carbimazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and hydrolysed to methimazole, which is concentrated in the thyroid within minutes of administration. methimazole has an apparent volume of distribution equivalent to body water and the t1 / 2 varies according to thyroid status, being approxi - mately seven, nine and 14 hours in hyperthyroid, euthyroid and hypothyroid patients, respectively. it is metabolized in the liver and thyroid. propyl thiouracil use propylthiouracil has similar actions, uses and toxic effects to carbimazole, but in addition inhibits the peripheral conver - sion of t 4 to active t 3. as with carbimazole, dangerous leukopenia may develop, but is very rare. the scheme of attaining a euthyroid state with',\n",
