       "  'empirical research in this area? this article addresses these questions and outlines an agenda for integrating social rela - tionships into current public health priorities moving forward. many people — from psychologists to public health offi - cials — will assume that public health prioritization refers to large - scale interventions and / or social engineering that somehow legislates “ better relationships ” for all ; under - standably, this perspective may lead to reactance and con - cerns that any public health focus on social relationships is premature, naive, or a form of unnecessary government involvement in matters of personal choice. however, quite simply, greater public health prioritization refers to direct - ing “ resources, time, and energy to those issues that are deemed most critical and practical to address ” centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc, 2013 ). such re - sources can be directed toward education ; basic and applied research ; surveillance ; containment and prevention efforts ; public health policy ; interventions ; and even, if the data supports it, social engineering. criteria for establishing public health priorities how are public health priorities established? with an increasing range of pressing health issues and limited re - sources, public and private health organizations must estab - lish priorities according to an established method that is fair, reasonable, and relatively easy to calculate. although a number of methods exist, this article relies on thebasic priority rating system ( bprs ; vilnius & dandoy, 1990 ) and the cdc ’ s ( 2013 ) prioritizing public health problems, which is consistent with the who ’ s ( 2016 ) health impact assessment. the primary criteria used to prioritize public health concerns are thesize and seriousness of the problem. according to these criteria, there is sufficient evidence to prioritize social relationships in public health. of course, the body of evidence in this area has been neither complete nor perfect — it has been',\n",
       "  'concerns are thesize and seriousness of the problem. according to these criteria, there is sufficient evidence to prioritize social relationships in public health. of course, the body of evidence in this area has been neither complete nor perfect — it has been fraught with gaps in the literature, issues of multiple causality, and disappointing interven - tions. however, similar challenges exist for other behavioral risk factors that receive considerable public health prioriti - zation, including diet, physical activity, tobacco use, and so forth. thus, despite these challenges, the analysis provided next articulates key evidence suggesting prioritization is both justified and necessary to improve public health. defining the problem when it comes to social relationships, what exactly is the problem? having too few relationships? lacking social contact, interaction, or perceived support? being lonely? lacking a close intimate partner or someone in the home to rely on in times of need? having strained or unsupportive relationships? even from this incomplete list, it is clear that the multifactorial conceptualization and measurement of social relationships may be a barrier to prioritization. one way to address this barrier is to define the problem as lacking social connection. the umbrella termsocial con - nection ( or social connectedness ) represents a multifactorial construct that includes structural, functional, and qualitative aspects of social relationships ( see table 1 ), all of which contribute to risk and protection. epidemiological research has generally focused on the structural ( e. g., social network size or density, marital status, living arrangements ) or func - tional ( e. g., received and perceived social support, per - ceived loneliness ) aspects of social relationships, and some work has included multidimensional approaches ( i. e., a combination of structural and functional aspects ; berkman, glass,',\n",

       "  'changes to community and societal action — are deeply rooted in science and the pursuit of translatable research findings. conclusion humans need others to survive. regardless of one ’ s sex, country or culture of origin, or age or economic back - ground, social connection is crucial to human development, health, and survival. the evidence ( summarized in figures 1 and 2a ) supporting this contention is unequivocal. when considering the umbrella termsocial connection and its constituent components, there are perhaps no other factors that can have such a large impact on both length and quality of life — from the cradle to the grave. yet, social connection is largely ignored as a health determinant because public and private stakeholders are not entirely sure how to act. in addition, the pace of developing effective social relationship interventions is considerably slow ; however, this is unlikely to change until social connection receives greater public health prioritization — in terms of both attention and re - sources. scientific progress is made through sustained efforts to find effective solutions, and the solutions for “ how to act ” are summarized in figure 2b. ultimately, to understand risk or protection, the causal mechanisms involved, and how to intervene to reduce risk and improve both physical and mental health, one must acknowledge influences ( and con - duct empirical research ) at all levels of analysis. just as the factors that contribute to multifaceted public health prob - lems ranging from violence to obesity have become better understood, now it is important to consider the micro - level ( e. g., genetic markers of susceptibility, gene – environment interactions ) to macro - level ( e. g., cultural norms, neighbor - hood characteristics ) processes through which social rela - tionships influence physical health, as well as the pathways by which one may intervene to reduce risk and improve public health. references anderson, l. m., shinn, c',\n",

       "  '48 3. food labels – a 2, 000 calorie diet is recommended for most people and when reading food labels it ’ s important to look at the serving size as well as the daily recommended percentage. if a label says that something is 250 calories but the meal / package contains two servings then it is important to know that the entire package is 500 calories. daily recommended value % s are important when it comes to other categories like grams of fat ( especially calories from fat ), and carbs. 4. physical activity – i started out walking or doing some type of activity for 20 minutes twice a week up to 30 minutes 3 or 4 times a week. walking around the block a few times and just getting out in the sun and fresh air really helped. of course, not everyone has that option or ability but anything that gets the cardio going like clapping to some music or even dancing in place can help. just even a little bit of activity for me helped to improve my mood and to feel better. 5. eating out – budgeting to eat out once a week and to buy off the dollar menu are good ideas. most fast food restaurants have information about calories and such and even offer healthy and affordable alternatives like salads and parfaits. even taco bell has a healthy alternative menu. on a website i recently visited ( helpguide. org ), i discovered that a double whopper with cheese, medium fries and an apple pie contains more saturated fat than the american heart association recommends people consume in two days. 6. meal planning / shopping – i don ’ t know much about this other than that in my opinion the generic brands of popular food items at the grocery store taste just as good as the name brands and are usually quite a bit cheaper. grocery shopping can be a big ordeal for a lot of people ( it is for me ) and overwhelming but it helped to',\n",
